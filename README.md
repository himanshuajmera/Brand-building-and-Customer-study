# Brand building and Customer study
This project include Linear and poly regression model implementation using R-programming. The aim of this project is to advice brand about the customer's prefernece for a product using the response of customer on social media. We have also implemented Transformation techniques to obtain an acceptable R-square value. 

Our data analysis study is focused on finding the relationships between online publications on social
networks and the impact of such publications measured by users' interactions. We used a dataset of
500 posts published on a Facebook social network brand page in a complete year by a renowned
cosmetic company for analysis.
The goal of this analysis is to implement a model that predicts the impact of posts using their
characteristics and assessing the knowledge provided by the model in terms of which input features
affect the impact metrics and how the input features influence each post, and hence supporting
managers' decisions.
This data analysis provides insight into the social media engagement of a cosmetic company and provides
predictions about the brand building. The manager will get help about current and future of their banding
on social media, by using this data he/she can decide the promotions. Also, the manager can decide
whether to post certain contents or not and if they want to post when to post, to catch maximum
customer attention.
